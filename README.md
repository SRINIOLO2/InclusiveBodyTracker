[Inclusive Body Composition Tracker üåàüí™
Version: 0.6 (Beta)

‚ú® What Makes This App Special?
Most body composition calculators assume a binary sex, which doesn't accurately reflect the complexities of body changes for transgender and intersex people, especially those undergoing hormone replacement therapy (HRT) or gender-affirming surgeries. Our app addresses this by introducing a groundbreaking "Femininity Crossfade" feature.

üíñ The Femininity Crossfade: A Revolutionary Approach
At the heart of this app is a unique slider that allows you to "crossfade" between masculine and feminine body composition calculations. This means you can:

Track Hormonal Changes: Visualize how your body composition shifts over time as hormones redistribute fat and alter muscle mass, reflecting the impact of HRT.

Log Surgical Milestones: Record data points around gender-affirming surgeries to see their effect on your body's overall composition.

Find Your Unique Range: For non-binary individuals, this feature provides the flexibility to create an average or desired body composition range that truly aligns with your identity, rather than being confined to rigid binary norms.

This isn't about assigning a "gender" to your body, but rather providing a flexible tool to interpret your physical metrics in a way that respects and validates your personal journey and goals.

üìä Key Features:
Comprehensive Measurement Inputs: Easily log your weight, height, age, neck, waist, and hip circumferences.

Dual Unit System: Seamlessly switch between Imperial (lbs, inches) and Metric (kg, cm) units, with all calculations and displays adjusting automatically.

Customizable Date Entries: Input current data or add historical measurements with specific dates, allowing you to build a detailed timeline of your body's evolution.

Historical Data Table: A clear, organized table displays all your past entries, including measurements, calculated results, and any personal notes.
